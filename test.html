    <h2>Lucilene DeWeese</h2>
    
      <h2>Lucy</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Lucilene DeWeese, but everyone calls me Lucy. Originally from Brazil, I've called Atlanta, Georgia, home for quite some time now. I have been married to Benjamin for 16 years, and together, we cherish the joys of raising two boys and a little girl.
While my primary role revolves around being a devoted stay-at-home mother, I wear various hats as I pursue a major in Web Design and Development. In the pockets of time between family and studies, I indulge my creative side through photography and various craft projects. Reading and camping are also among my favorite pastimes, and whenever possible, I attend concerts of my favorite band, Hanson.
The year 2000 marked a pivotal moment in my life when missionaries found me and my friends, introducing me to the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Since then, my faith has been a guiding force, bringing profound experiences like the memorable visit last year to the Curitiba Temple with my best friends and brother.
Now, as a student at BUY-I, I'm excited about the prospect of integrating my faith into my studies. Knowing that I can turn to prayer for guidance when faced with challenges is a comforting aspect of my educational journey. I am eager to dive into this course, recognizing it as a fantastic opportunity to enhance my skills as a web designer. With faith and enthusiasm, I look forward to the transformative learning experience ahead.
